# Drafts sentiment analysis - Hugging Face model

Calculates sentiment of draft messages (unsent messages while user is typing)

[This project](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/Sentiment-Analysis) generates a prediction with a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) model: 
- It listens to the input topic for input data to predict on.
- It generates a prediction using the selected Hugging Face model.
- It outputs the class and score of the prediction to the selected output topic.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/self-sign-up?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Deploy` on the Sample, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the raw data input topic.
- **output**: This is the output for the hugging face model score.

## Requirements/prerequisites
When deploying this Python project, ensure you allow enough computational resources (1GB RAM) to host and execute the Hugging Face pipeline objects.
